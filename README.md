# Doodshell

Some basic git commands I find myself using frequently enough that I need to know them but not frequently enough to remember them.

Install them into your Powershell Profile by cloning the repo and then adding the following to your Powershell Profile:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name [path-to-commonfunctions.ps1] -Force
Import-Module -Name [path-to-gitfunction.ps1] -Force
```
